OLIVIA 
Your lord does know my mind. I cannot love him.
Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,
Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;
In voices well divulged, free, learned, and valiant,
And in dimension and the shape of nature
A gracious person. But yet I cannot love him.
He might have took his answer long ago.

VIOLA 
If I did love you in my master’s flame,
With such a suff’ring, such a deadly life,
In your denial I would find no sense.
I would not understand it.

OLIVIA
You might do much.
What is your parentage?

VIOLA 
Above my fortunes, yet my state is well.
I am a gentleman.

OLIVIA 
I’ll be sworn thou art.
Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions, and spirit
Do give thee fivefold blazon.
What ho, Malvolio! Run after that same peevish messenger!
