
SEBASTIAN
Do I stand there? I never had a brother,
Nor can there be that deity in my nature
Of here and everywhere. I had a sister
Whom the blind waves and surges have devoured.
Of charity, what kin are you to me?
What countryman? What name? What parentage?

VIOLA 
Of Messaline. Sebastian was my father.
Such a Sebastian was my brother too.
If nothing lets to make us happy both
But this my masculine usurped attire,
Do not embrace me till each circumstance of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump that I am Viola.
The Captain that did bring me first on shore Hath my maid’s garments
